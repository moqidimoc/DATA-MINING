KEY SOLUTIONS TO COURSEWORK 1

SOLUTION TO PART 1 (CLASSIFICATION):
classification.py = reads data from KEATS ('adult.csv') and answers the questions asked in the Coursework 1 Part 1. It will print out the following information:
		    - Dataframe's main information.
		    - Answer to question 1: table with descriptive information of the values of the data set.
		    - Answer to question 2: set of possible discrete values for each attribute of the data set.
		    - Answer to question 3: error rate and other evaluation metrics for the model trained with data from the data set without missing values (X).
		    - Answer to question 4: error rate and other evaluation metrics for the models trained with data from D1' and D2' (explained in the Coursework and in the Report).

SOLUTION TO PART 2 (CLUSTERING):
clustering.py = reads data directly from KEATS ('Wholesale customers data.csv') and answers the questions asked in the Coursework 1 Part 2. It will print out the following information:
		    - Dataframe's main information.
		    - Answer to question 1: table with descriptive information of the attributes of the data set.
		    - Answer to question 2: 15 different plots for each pair of attributes. These plots will show the clustering done with k=3 and their centroids.
		    - Answer to question 3: the main metrics of kMeans for k={3, 5, 10}. This is the BC (Between Cluster Score), the WC (the Within Cluster Score) and the Ratio BC/WC.
		    - Answer to question 3 (bis): a table with the metrics mentioned in the previous bullet point.
