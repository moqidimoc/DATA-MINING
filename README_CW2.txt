KEY SOLUTIONS TO COURSEWORK 2

SOLUTION TO PART 1 (TEXT MINING):
text_mining.py = reads data from KEATS ('Corona_NLP_train.csv') and answers the questions asked in the Coursework 2 Part 1. It will print out the following information:
		    - Answer to question 1: the possible sentiments a tweet may have, the second most popular sentiment, the day with the greatest number of 'Extremely Positive' tweets. It
					    also prints the execution time for this task.
		    - Answer to question 2: total number of words (repetitions included), total number of unique words, top-10 most frequent words, total number of words (repetitions 
					    included), without stopwords and short words (2 characters or less), total number of unique words, without stopwords and short words (2 
					    characters or less), top-10 most frequent words, without stopwords and short words (2 characters or less). It also prints the execution time for
					    task.
		    - Answer to question 3: plots a histogram with word frequencies and a plot with the top-20 words with the highest frequency. It also prints the execution time for this
					    task.
		    - Answer to question 4: the training accuracy of the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes model applied on the tweet data. It also prints the execution time for this task.
		    - The execution time for the complete script.


SOLUTION TO PART 2 (IMAGE PROCESSING):
image_processing.py = reads data from KEATS (four different images) and answers the questions asked in the Coursework 2 Part 2. It will print out the following information:
		    - Answer to question 1: it shows the image (Avengers movie cover) and prints the shape of the image. It also plots the original movie cover alongside with the two
					    representations (grayscale and black-and-white).
		    - Answer to question 2: it shows the image (Bush House from Wikipedia) and plots the original image alongside with the image with Gaussian noise, the image after
					    applying a Gaussian smoothing mask and after applying a Uniform smoothing mask.
		    - Answer to question 3: it shows the image (landscape from the Forestry Commission) and plots the original image alongside with the two segmentations applied to the
					    image (k-means segmentation based on the colour and k-means segmentation based on the colour and the position) in its original format and with
					    original image superimposed.
		    - Answer to question 4: it shows the image (Rolland Garros tennis court) and plots the original image alongside with the image after applying the Canny Edge Detection
					    algorithm and after applying the Hough Transform.
